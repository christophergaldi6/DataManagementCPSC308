-- 1. Create the next four tables in your existing Bowling Leagues database. Make sure to have the correct data types based on the original versions of each table.
-- a. Tournaments Archive
-- b. Tourney_Matches_Archive 
-- c. Match_Games_Arhcive
-- d. Bowler_Scores_Archive

CREATE TABLE Tournaments_Archive (
    TourneyID       INT           NOT NULL,
    TourneyDate     DATE,
    TourneyLocation NVARCHAR (50)

    MatchID        INT          NOT NULL,
    Tourney        [ID INT],
    Lanes          NVARCHAR (5),
    OddLaneTeamID  INT,
    EvenLaneTeamID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Match_Games_Archive (
    MatchID       INT      NOT NULL,
    GameNumber    SMALLINT NOT NULL,
    WinningTeamID INT
);

UPDATE Teams
   SET TeamName = 'Manta Rays'

-- 5. Delete all the tournament data that has been copied to the archive tables. You will need four queries

DELETE FROM Tournaments

);

DELETE FROM Tourney_Matches
      WHERE (TourneyID, MatchID) IN (

DELETE FROM Bowler_Scores
      WHERE (MatchID, BowlerID) IN (
    SELECT MatchID,
           BowlerID

-- 6. Delete all bowling matches that have not been played

DELETE FROM Tourney_Matches
